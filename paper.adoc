== Abstract

// * Motivation: Why did this work come about? Why is the topic of the
// work interesting (for the general public)? The motivation should be
// abstracted as far as possible from the specific tasks that may be given
// by a company.
// * Content: What is the content of this thesis? What exactly is covered in
// the thesis? The methodology and working method should be briefly
// discussed here.
// * Results: What are the results of this work? A brief overview of the
// Most actual results as a teaser to read the complete thesis.


Participating in the hacker contest course requires a submitting a solution for the qualification exercise <<Goh24>>.

== Introduction

=== Background

A small company hired an IT consultant to generate certificates for various services. As soon as the consultant completed the work and left the building, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) used in the company detected an attack on the server set up specifically for this purpose. Concerned about the security of the generated certificates, the company requests a forensic investigation of the server to determine whether there has been an attack on the system and, if so, what data has been stolen from the system. Any information that can be found about the attacker is also of importance.

The server itself has the IP address `192.168.0.1``. The consultant used the username `root` and either worked directly on the computer or from the addresses `192.168.5.23`` and `192.168.23.5``. Otherwise, no one else should have had access to the computer. The consultant set up the computer in the morning and generated the certificates. Immediately afterward, he left the premises. Shortly thereafter, the IDS system reported the attack.

=== Objectives

==== Tasks

.Questions
* Should the certificates still be used?
* Can the system still be used?
* If there was an attack:
  * How did the attacker get into the system?
  * What did the attacker do?
  * What has to be done to secure the system?
  * Which details about the attacker can be found?

.Additional Questions
* Is the configuration of the server secure?
* Should a CA be operated in this manner?
* How should the software written by the consulatant be assessed?

==== Hypotheses

==== Domain terms

List term in the domain. We need define domain related terms, e.g., terms used when we
investigate a fraud related to accounting.

‚Ä¢ Accounts receivable: fill out the definition here.
‚Ä¢ Certified public accountant: fill out the definition here.

== Suspect action timeline

== Investigator activity logs

I did not work on any live data, so there is no risk of contaminating the evidence.


== Conclusion

=== Recommendations for securing the server

// The head of the technology department not only expects a final report on the data but also desires a bullet-point list of suggestions for strengthening the server. Due to other ongoing projects, the server should not be rebuilt but rather utilized further. Is this advisable?
